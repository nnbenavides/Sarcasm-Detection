# Project Title

This repository contains code for 2 projects on sarcasm detection. The code at the main level of this repo was developed for the final project of Stanford's CS224N (Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning), which extended a previous course project and explored additional ways to extract contextual information using deeper models and attention. Code for the previous course project, which was a final project for Stanford's CS 224U (Natural Language Understanding), can be found in the old_project folder, and it explores the value of including context at the embedding level (comparing GloVe vs ELMo) and at the model-level (comparing a feed-forward NN with a bidirectional LSTM).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
1. Create a new Python3 virtual environment

Run python3 -m venv [your virtual environment name]
To activate your virtual environment, run  source [your virtual environment name]/bin/activate

2. Python >= 3.6

To check your python version, run python -V. If the Python version is less than 3.6, you will need to install a new version of python. You can follow [this tutorial](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) if you need to upgrade your Python version.

3. numpy

If you have pip, you can simply run pip install numpy

4. NLTK

If you have pip, simply run pip install --user -U nltk

5. Pytorch 1.4.0

If you have pip, simply run pip install torch==1.4.0

6. scikit-learn

If you have pip, simply run pip install sklearn

7. allennlp (requires Python >= 3.6)

If you have pip, simply run pip install allennlp
```
